Write it down.
This is a simple tool to let users submit requests and vote on their importance.
Users to **not** need to login or create an account to make a requet or vote

### Requirements

 - `DATABASE_URL` to point to the database
 - The `templates` directory, I think

If there is no pre-built binary then go 1.21+ is required
